I'm currently an MS student at Carnegie Mellon University in artificial intelligence engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering department.
advised by Prof [Limin Jia](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/liminjia/).
Prior to CMU, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Chongqing University, worked with Prof [Juan Yu](http://www.cee.cqu.edu.cn/en/FACULTY_STAFF/Faculties/YU_Juan.htm) and I got a joint program degree at University of Cincinnati in 2023, worked with Prof [Wei Wei](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/weiw3) and Prof [Fred Chiou](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/chioufd). 

__I'm applying to PhD program in 25 Fall.__ My research interests are AI safety and ML systems. I study attacks and defense on machine learning systems with the evaluation of robustness. Also, I'd like to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve practical and engineering problems.
