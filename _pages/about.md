I'm currently an MS student at Carnegie Mellon University in artificial intelligence engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering department.
advised by Prof [Limin Jia](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/liminjia/).
Prior to CMU, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Chongqing University, worked with Prof [Juan Yu](http://www.cee.cqu.edu.cn/en/FACULTY_STAFF/Faculties/YU_Juan.htm) and I got a joint program degree at University of Cincinnati in 2023, worked with Prof [Wei Wei](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/weiw3) and Prof [Fred Chiou](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/chioufd). 

__I'm applying to PhD program in 25 Fall.__ My research interests are AI safety and ML systems. I study attacks and defense on machine learning systems with the evaluation of robustness. Also, I'd like to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve practical and engineering problems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
